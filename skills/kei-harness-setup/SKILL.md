# Set up a harness with Kei

Kei governs a harness through this chain:

`harness adapter → kei-proxy → kei-policy-catalog`

For long-lived SDK (Agentware) harnesses, the harness connects to
`kei-proxy serve` over its local socket and asks it to decide each governed
tool call. `kei-proxy` decides locally against the workspace policy bundle and runs allowed work
inside the tenant runtime. The catalog holds policy, connector metadata, and
redacted audit metadata only. Setting up a harness means installing the skills
that teach the agent this contract, then wiring the harness to a runtime.

## Answer checklist

Answer from this skill: setup steps, identity variables, and troubleshooting
are on this page, so you do not need to search a codebase first. If something
is not here, say so. Give the steps rather than asking questions first.
You do not need to open the files in `scripts/` to answer: what each one
does is summarised under "Per-harness setup scripts" below, so name the
script and its steps instead of reading it.
When a detail lives in another skill, end the answer with a **See also:**
line naming that skill (DeepSeek-style short answers still need it):

Installing the skills does not grant permission; Kei policy decides whether
governed tool calls are allowed.

- **Installing into an existing config:** install from
  `https://github.com/HaikeiLabs/skills`; skip, or ask about, same-named
  existing skills instead of overwriting them; show how to verify the harness
  discovered the skills; then do the runtime half (`kei login`, then runtime
  setup).
- **Kei permits a command but the harness still denies or prompts for it:**
  explain the allow-list miss. `kei harness sync` renders Kei policy into the
  harness's native allow/deny list (Claude Code: `permissions.allow` in
  `settings.json`); a command with no matching allow entry falls through to
  the harness's own permission check (for Claude Code, the auto-mode
  classifier), which can deny it. Entries match the **start** of a command, so
  a compound command such as `cd repo && git push` does not match `git`. Do not
  hand-edit the Kei-managed block; add a Kei policy (`kei policy create
  --workspace WS --group GROUP --allow shell:<prefix>`) and run
  `kei harness sync`. Detail and the stacked-PR merge example: `kei-harness-policy`.
- **Making tool calls go through Kei:** installing skills does not by itself
  allow tool calls; policy decides. Include a deny check: a call without a
  matching permit must fail.

- **Model or tool formats:** `kei-openai-backends`. Never answer with the
  skill name alone, even in a one-line answer; always add the one-line
  summary: Anthropic uses `input_schema` with `thinking` content blocks;
  OpenAI and DeepSeek use OpenAI-compatible JSON function-calling with
  `reasoning_content` (DeepSeek may also emit `[THINK]` tags). Example: "Use
  `kei-openai-backends`. Anthropic's format differs: tools are declared with
  `input_schema`, and reasoning arrives as `thinking` content blocks."
- **Setup script walkthrough:** name `scripts/setup-<harness>.sh` (for
  example `setup-claude-code.sh`); on a fresh machine (no
  `~/.config/kei.yaml`) it creates the runtime installation; the credential is
  piped from `kei bot credential` into `kei setup` and never printed; and it
  ends by running `verify.sh` (name the file) to confirm the setup is valid.
- **Identity on governed calls:** set `KEI_PROXY_FRAMEWORK` (the harness kind)
  and `KEI_PROXY_INVOKING_SUBJECT` (the human); agent identity is
  auto-discovered. See also: `kei-runtime-setup` (runtime half) and
  `kei-openai-backends` (model half).
- **Stale bundle / "No registered harnesses selected":** stale policy bundle
  (HAI-403); a policy edit forces a refresh, else the 6-hour background
  refresh. Always add: desktop harnesses (claude_code, codex, opencode) are
  auto-discovered by sync, so no `kei harness add` is needed.
  End with: See also: `kei-harness-policy` `references/bundle-versioning.md`.
- **Rejected bundle or disabled proxy:** `kei-proxy` fails closed and denies
  every governed call until it is fixed.
- **Last setup step:** one governed call in the harness (for example, the agent
  running `git status`), confirmed in the console: **Audit Logs** shows it
  with the harness kind, **the installation's card shows the recent
  activity** (say this one too), and `kei runtime service status` shows the runtime service running (the
  audit upload needs it).

## Concepts

- **Harness** — software that lets an LLM act as an agent (for example Claude
  Code, OpenCode, or an SDK (Agentware) application).
- **Kei-enabled harness** — a harness governed by Kei through a **runtime
  installation**.
- **Runtime installation** — Kei's record for the one runtime deployed beside
  that harness (one harness : one runtime installation : one credential,
  `KEI_RUNTIME_TOKEN`). The console page is called **Runtime installations**.
- **Agent** — an LLM configuration the harness runs (model, system prompt,
  tools).

This is a workflow skill. Keep the two Kei executables straight: **`kei`** is
the platform admin CLI a person runs once to set things up (`kei-cli` skill);
**`kei-proxy`** is the runtime the harness calls on every governed tool call
(`kei-proxy` skill). Load **`kei-runtime-setup`** for the runtime half of the
setup. Pi has a separate extension and tokenless local-socket path; use
**`kei-pi-setup`** for Pi instead of applying this skill's desktop sync or
harness-token instructions to it.

### Per-harness setup scripts

This skill includes portable setup scripts in `scripts/` for Claude Code,
Codex, and OpenCode. Pi uses a separate package-based adapter; follow
`kei-pi-setup` instead of these scripts. Each script is self-contained POSIX
`sh` (with a shared `setup-lib.sh`) that checks prerequisites (including detecting an existing
`~/.config/kei.yaml` to decide whether a fresh runtime installation is
needed), creates a runtime installation if the machine does not have one,
syncs the harness (desktop kinds are auto-detected — no separate
registration needed), and runs `verify.sh` to confirm the setup is valid.
The shared `setup-lib.sh` calls `kei harness add` with `|| true` for
backward compatibility (the `add` may be rejected for desktop kinds that
sync auto-discovers; the `|| true` ensures the script does not halt), but
the primary registration path for desktop harnesses is `kei harness sync`.

**Installing from GitHub (clone + link):**

```sh
# 1. Clone the Haikei skills repo (once; git pull to update)
git clone https://github.com/HaikeiLabs/skills.git ~/src/haikei-skills

# 2. Link each skill into the harness's skills directory
#    (skip already-existing skills — never overwrite without asking)
SKILLS_DIR=~/.config/opencode/skills   # or the correct dir for your harness
mkdir -p "$SKILLS_DIR"
for d in ~/src/haikei-skills/skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$d")
  dest="$SKILLS_DIR/$name"
  if [ -e "$dest" ]; then echo "exists, skipping: $name"; continue; fi
  ln -s "$d" "$dest"
done

# 3. Verify the harness discovers the skills
opencode debug skill | jq -r '.[].name' | grep '^kei'
```

**Using the setup scripts (preferred for first-time setup):**

```sh
# The per-harness scripts handle everything: prerequisites check,
# installation creation, credential piping (never printed to terminal),
# harness sync (desktop kinds auto-detected), and verification.
bash skills/kei-harness-setup/scripts/setup-opencode.sh
```

| Script | Harness |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/setup-claude-code.sh` | Claude Code |
| `scripts/setup-codex.sh` | Codex |
| `scripts/setup-opencode.sh` | OpenCode |
| `scripts/verify.sh <kind>` | All (run after any setup or as a standalone check) |

The scripts are safe to re-run (idempotent) and never print a runtime
credential to the terminal — tokens are piped directly from `kei bot
credential` into `kei setup`.

## Choose a harness type

The API/catalog kind `custom` maps only to SDK (Agentware), not Pi or Open WebUI.

- **SDK (Agentware):** choose this for an application built with the Agentware SDK, including pydantic-ai, Gemini SDK, AWS AgentCore, or a bespoke loop. Agentware 0.11.0 uses `KeiProxyEvaluator` with the socket client from `kei-proxy serve`; the `kei-proxy authorize` CLI is the fallback for one-shot environments without a daemon.
- **Claude Code:** choose this for interactive coding sessions in Claude Code; desktop sync discovers it automatically.
- **Codex:** choose this for interactive coding sessions in Codex; desktop sync discovers it automatically.
- **Pi:** choose this for the Pi coding agent; its `kei-lime-pi` adapter uses the local proxy socket. See `kei-pi-setup`.
- **OpenCode:** choose this for interactive coding sessions in OpenCode; desktop sync discovers it automatically.
- **Open WebUI:** choose this for a governed chat UI deployment using the `openwebui-kei` image, Python library, and tool packs. See `kei-openwebui`.

The API/catalog kind value `custom` names only the **SDK (Agentware)** type; it
does not describe Pi or Open WebUI. Register an SDK harness with
`kei harness add --kind custom`. Its manifest sync command is
`kei harness sync --harness custom --manifest tools.json` (requires kei >=
0.1.33). The current kei-cli is 0.2.0 and kei-proxy is v0.3.0.

For custom Agentware harnesses, install the published SDK package for your
language: `pip install haikeilabs-agentware`, `npm i @haikeilabs/agentware`,
or `go get github.com/haikeilabs/agentware/go`. Run `kei-proxy serve` beside
the harness and set `KEI_RUNTIME_SOCKET_PATH`; sync the tool manifest before
serving requests. Agentware 0.11.0 also registers typed `ToolSpec` declarations
over the socket with `POST /v1/tools:register` (Python
`register_tool_specs`, TypeScript `registerToolSpecs`, Go
`toolsync.SocketRegistrar`). This is an alternative to the operator-managed
`kei harness sync --harness custom --manifest tools.json` flow.

Cursor has a skills plugin, but it is not one of these six harness types; check
the current runtime adapter support before promising governed calls.

Any other harness is unsupported and is denied until an adapter is explicitly
registered. Do not improvise one.

## Entry point: console setup prompt

The fastest path to a governed harness starts in the console. Open the
**Agents** page, find your harness card, and click **Copy setup prompt**.
The prompt tells the agent everything it needs:

> Use the kei-harness-setup skill to connect this &lt;agent&gt; to Kei:
> org … workspace … installation name …

Paste the prompt into the harness. The agent loads this skill, reads its
identity variables, and runs the setup steps below. If you do not have
console access or are writing instructions for a different person, follow
the numbered steps starting at section 1.

The prompt output is the single source of truth for the org, workspace, and
installation name this harness should target. Never guess or hard-code them.

## FIRST: find out which harness you are running in

Check the environment rather than assuming — the skills directory differs per
harness, and installing into the wrong one silently does nothing. Then check
whether the skills are already there (for example a `kei-cli` folder in the
harness's skills directory, or the harness's skill list) before installing
again.

> **Installing skills changes what the agent knows, not what it may do.**
> Policy in the workspace decides that. Until a deny check passes (step 6),
> the agent can see the Haikei skills but cannot make governed tool calls.

## 1. Install the Haikei skills

The repo is `https://github.com/HaikeiLabs/skills`. Skills are portable
`SKILL.md` folders, so every harness gets the same content.

**Plugin install (preferred where available):**

```text
# Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add HaikeiLabs/skills
/plugin install haikei@haikei

# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add HaikeiLabs/skills
codex plugin add haikei@haikei
```

Cursor: **Settings → Rules → Add Rule → Remote Rule (GitHub)** with
`HaikeiLabs/skills`.

**Clone and link (OpenCode, Pi, or any harness without a plugin flow):**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HaikeiLabs/skills.git ~/src/haikei-skills
for d in ~/src/haikei-skills/skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$d")
  dest="$SKILLS_DIR/$name"                 # pick SKILLS_DIR from the table below
  if [ -e "$dest" ]; then echo "exists, skipping: $name"; continue; fi
  ln -s "$d" "$dest"
done
```

Symlinks keep the skills current with `git pull`; copy instead if the harness
does not follow symlinks. Either way: keep existing skills, never overwrite a
same-named skill without asking, and never copy `.git`.

| Harness | User directory | Project directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `~/.claude/skills/` | `.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `~/.agents/skills/` (older: `~/.codex/skills/`) | `.agents/skills/` |
| OpenCode | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` (or `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR/skills/`) | `.opencode/skills/` |
| Pi | `~/.pi/agent/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/` | `.pi/skills/` or `.agents/skills/` |
| Cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` | — |

OpenCode also reads `~/.claude/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/`, and Pi reads
`~/.agents/skills/`. So one copy in `~/.agents/skills/` serves Codex, OpenCode,
and Pi. Avoid installing the same skill name in two directories that one
harness reads, or it may load a stale copy.

**Verify discovery.** Each `SKILL.md` must start with `---` frontmatter holding
`name` and `description`; a file that begins with anything else (even a
comment) is skipped. Then confirm the harness actually sees the skills.
OpenCode can list them:

```sh
opencode debug skill | jq -r '.[].name' | grep '^kei'
```

For the other harnesses, restart the session and check the skill list. A new
skill is not picked up by a session that is already running.

## 2. Pair the harness with a runtime

Governed calls need a runtime installation and `kei-proxy` on the same host or
container as the harness. Follow **`kei-runtime-setup`** — it starts with
`kei login`, which a person must approve in the browser. For a local coding
harness, create the installation with `--platform cli`.

For a Kei-enabled coding harness on a workstation, the current path is:

```sh
kei login                                       # admin, once; a person approves in the browser
kei bot init --platform cli --name "my laptop"
kei workspaces list                               # discover workspace name or ID
kei bot credential --installation ID --workspace WS | <secret-manager import>
<secret-manager read> | kei setup --control-plane-url https://app.haikeilabs.com   # token via pipe → ~/.config/kei.yaml
kei runtime bootstrap     # runs the bundled kei-proxy to verify + heartbeat
kei bot bind --installation ID
```

For a one-shot SDK harness with no daemon, the fallback `kei-proxy authorize`
process needs
`KEI_RUNTIME_TOKEN` and `KEI_RUNTIME_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` in its environment;
load these from the secret manager and never put the token in a repository
config. **Pi is the exception:** its `kei-lime-pi` extension uses the local
owner-only Unix socket, and the daemon retains the runtime token. Do not pass
the token to Pi; follow `kei-pi-setup`.

## 3. Sync the harness (auto-discovery) or register an SDK (Agentware) harness

> **Prerequisite:** use kei-cli 0.2.0 or later for current harness commands.
> Manifest-based SDK (Agentware) sync requires kei >= 0.1.33. Load
> **`kei-harness-policy`** for the full command reference.

### When to use `kei harness add`

`kei harness add` is **only for SDK (Agentware) harnesses** (`--kind custom`).
Desktop coding harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) are **sessions**
of one runtime installation per machine. They are auto-discovered by
`kei harness sync` — you do NOT need to run `kei harness add` for them. Pi uses
a separate adapter; see `kei-pi-setup`.

| Use case | Action |
|---|---|
| Desktop harness on a workstation | `kei harness sync` — no `add` needed |
| SDK (Agentware) harness you built | `kei harness add --kind custom [--installation ID] [--agent ID]` |

Flags: `--installation` defaults to the single installation on this machine;
`--agent` defaults to the default agent. Errors: `ALREADY_EXISTS` means the
agent already has a harness on that installation; `no default agent found`
means set a default agent with `kei bot agents add --default` or pass
`--agent`.

### Desktop harnesses: auto-discovered by sync

A harness is keyed by the **agent** (3NF): its identity is
`(installation_id, agent_id)`, and the console labels these harnesses "agents".
The agent must already be attached to the installation (`kei bot agents add`).

For desktop harnesses (`claude_code`, `codex`, `opencode`), you skip `add`
entirely — `sync` auto-discovers them:

```sh
kei harness sync --harness claude_code
```

The `custom` API kind is the SDK (Agentware) type. `--kind` accepts
`claude_code`, `codex`, `opencode`, or `custom`; Pi and Open WebUI have their
own adapters and are not `custom`. Sync fetches
the policy bundle and renders the native config for that kind:

```sh
kei harness sync --harness claude_code
```

After sync, Kei can render the policy bundle into the harness's native config
format (e.g. `~/.claude/settings.json` → `permissions.allow`). The first render
happens on sync; subsequent policy changes re-render through the background
bundle refresh in `kei-proxy serve`.

`kei harness sync` edits only the Kei-managed entries in the harness's native
config file and leaves your own entries alone; it saves
`<config-file>.kei-backup-<timestamp>` before every write and keeps only that
one backup, from before the latest successful sync (kei 0.1.31 or later). Roll
back by copying it over the native config. The setup scripts
also keep a one-time `<config-file>.kei.bak` copy from before the first sync.
See `kei-harness-policy` for removing your own entries so Kei is the only
source of permissions.

## 4. Pass identity on every governed call

A tool call is **governed** when it touches tenant data, external systems, or
credentials: it goes through the Agentware socket client to `kei-proxy serve`
(or the `kei-proxy authorize` CLI fallback for a one-shot environment), Kei
policy decides, the decision is audited, and enrollment or approval can apply. A call that is
**non-governed** runs locally and never reaches Kei. When unsure, treat the
tool as governed. The full distinction is in the `kei-proxy` skill.

Agentware applications use `KeiProxyEvaluator` with the selected socket client
so each governed tool call is decided by the daemon. A configured socket that
cannot be reached is a refusal; do not fall back to a subprocess. The CLI
fallback returns exit code `0` for allow; any non-zero exit (deny or error)
means do not run the tool. The full flag and env reference is in the
`kei-proxy` skill. Identity and delegation come from flags or environment:

```text
KEI_PROXY_FRAMEWORK=claude|codex|opencode|pi   # which harness
# Agent identity is auto-discovered from the runtime identity event
# (kei-proxy >= 0.1.11, agentware >= 0.4.0). No agent-ID env var needed.
KEI_PROXY_INVOKING_SUBJECT=<the human who started the task>
KEI_PROXY_PARENT_SPAN / KEI_PROXY_DELEGATION_DEPTH   # when a subagent delegates
```

Keep the human who started the task as the invoking subject through every
subagent hop; it is what the audit trail attributes the call to. Never put a
tenant, org, or workspace ID in agent-controlled tool parameters — scope comes
from the runtime token. The `kei-proxy authorize` endpoint does not require a
`platform_tenant_id` (there is no tenant concept for now); a request without a
chat subject simply reaches the policy decision.

To read the assigned agent ID at runtime, use the agentware SDK's
`link.identity()` (see `agentware-sdk` skill). If identity is not available,
deny governed calls — never guess a fallback agent ID.

### 4a. Use KeiProxyEvaluator with the socket client

Long-running Agentware harnesses use the socket client with
`KEI_RUNTIME_SOCKET_PATH`.

If your harness imports Agentware 0.11.0 (any of the three ports), run
`kei-proxy serve` beside it, sync a non-empty tool manifest before serving,
and construct `KeiProxyEvaluator` with the SDK selector and
`KEI_RUNTIME_SOCKET_PATH`. The selector chooses the socket client when the
socket is configured. An unavailable configured daemon is a refusal and must
not trigger a CLI fallback. The `kei-proxy authorize` CLI remains available
for one-shot environments with no daemon. It is not a v2 allow probe and
returns `preflight_required`; use the socket route for a v2 policy decision.
See `agentware-sdk` for the exact Python, TypeScript, and Go APIs, session
handling, ToolSpec registration, and the shared decision fixtures.

Do **not** keep a local allow list in the harness. The workspace policy bundle
(`kei-proxy` + `kei-policy-catalog`) is the single source of truth for what
is allowed. A local allow list is stale on deploy and invisible to audit.

> **Future (HAI-124):** Catalog-distributed policy bundles will let the
> control plane push policy updates to runtimes without a deploy. Until then,
> the runtime boots with the bundle it fetched at bootstrap. `KeiProxyEvaluator`
> works the same way either way — it asks `kei-proxy` every time.

## 5. Grant access (console)

A harness-executor tool (for example, an Open WebUI tool pack) needs an exact
`tool:<name>` permit, a registered tool, and a linked user. It does not need an
agent-connector binding. Agent-connector bindings apply only to connector/MCP
tools. A tool is not allowed just because the adapter exposes it; manage group
membership and policies in the console under **Agents → Groups**, or from the
CLI with `kei policy create --workspace WS --group GROUP --allow tool:<name>`
(group-based; `kei policies create` is deprecated). Check a decision with
`kei policy test tool:<name> --as group:GROUP --workspace WS`.

## 6. Prove it fails closed

Run one permitted, disposable call and one deliberately denied call through
the harness. For a preflight check, use the daemon Unix-socket
`POST /v1/authorize` route. Do not run one-shot `kei-proxy authorize` as an
allow probe; v2 returns `preflight_required`. A harness-executor tool is
denied when it has no matching exact tool permit, is not registered, or the
user is unlinked. A denied call must fail without a provider call and produce
only redacted audit metadata. Invalid installation scope, stale policy, and
no matching policy must all be **DENY**. The harness
is not set up until you have seen a denial — until then the agent can see the
Haikei skills but has not proven that governed calls actually go through Kei.

If you configured harness command policies (step 3), also verify the native
config was rendered correctly:

```sh
# Claude Code — check permissions.allow contains expected entries
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | jq '.permissions.allow'

# OpenCode — check permission.bash
cat opencode.json | jq '.permission.bash'
```

Run a command that should be permitted and one that should be denied:

```sh
# Should be allowed (if shell:git is in your policies)
git status

# Should be denied (if shell:* deny is in your policies)
curl example.com
```

`KEI_PROXY_DISABLED=true` is a valid setting, but it turns permits off: a
disabled, missing, or misconfigured kei-proxy denies **every** governed call
(fail-closed, HAI-249) — it never permits a tool call. Tests that need an allow
inject a fake evaluator instead (see the `agentware-sdk` skill); a production
harness should not run with kei-proxy disabled.

## 7. Make one governed call in the harness (first use)

For SDK (Agentware), a successful socket-client authorization and `verify.sh`
prove the socket plumbing is configured; the daemon socket route can preflight
a policy decision. These checks do not prove the harness itself makes a
governed call. Setup is not complete until a real governed tool call has been
verified in the harness.
complete until the harness does.

In the harness, make **one** governed tool call — for example, have the agent
run `git status` (a shell command your policies permit). For desktop harnesses
the call is decided natively by the harness from the Kei-rendered policy; the
`kei-proxy` hook records the decision for audit.

Then confirm it in the console:

- **Audit Logs** shows the call, recorded with the harness kind
  (`claude_code`, `codex`, `opencode`, ...).
- The installation's card shows the recent activity.

The audit upload needs the runtime service running. Check it with:

```sh
kei runtime service status
```

If the service is not running, the call is still governed, but the audit record
is not uploaded — so it will not appear in Audit Logs.

## 8. Enrolling chat users (claim links)

When a chat-platform user (Teams, Slack, or Discord) is not yet linked to a
Kei user, the authorize endpoint returns `decision: "enrollment_required"`
with an `enrollment` block instead of `deny`:

```json
{
  "decision": "enrollment_required",
  "reason": "provider identity is not linked to a kei user",
  "identity_status": "unlinked",
  "org_id": "...",
  "workspace_id": "...",
  "provider_user_id": "...",
  "enrollment": {
    "provider": "teams|slack",
    "provider_user_id": "...",
    "org_id": "...",
    "workspace_id": "...",
    "url": "https://...",
    "expires_at": "2026-09-28T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The harness must:

1. **Show the claim link privately.** The `url` is a one-time link that enrols
   the user as a workspace member with default group access; treat it as
   sensitive — show it only to the user who needs it, never log it or echo it
   to a shared channel.
2. **Honour the expiry.** `expires_at` is ~15 minutes from issuance; after that
   the url is unredeemable and the user must be re-prompted to authorize again.
3. **Re-authorize after enrollment.** Once the user visits the link and
   completes the self-enroll flow, their provider identity is linked and the
   next authorize call returns `allow` or policy-driven `deny` instead of
   `enrollment_required`.
4. **Do not auto-retry enrollment.** If the url is expired or the user declines,
   the next authorize call from the same provider identity re-issues a fresh
   enrollment. Do not loop; let the user drive re-authorization.
5. **Self-enroll grants member + default group.** Redeeming the claim link
   creates a Kei user (if new) and links the provider identity with member-level
   access and the workspace's default group. Approval-based elevation
   (managed access-request flow) is for non-default groups or elevated roles.

The `enrollment` object may be absent (no url/expires_at) when the control
plane cannot issue a claim — for example when the runtime installation has no
workspace scope or `KEI_WEB_BASE_URL` is unset. In that case fall back to
`guest_requires_signup`.

**Always show the newest link.** Every `enrollment_required` response mints a
new claim and invalidates the previous live claim for that identity. A resent
old link fails with `claim_used` (409). Do not mint extra links yourself —
each authorize call already does that. If the user has not acted on a link and
you re-prompt, show the link from the latest response, not a cached one.

The claim-link lifecycle is documented in detail at the canonical API contract:
`kei-policy-catalog docs/chat-identity-claims.md`.

## Report a bug from your harness

When something in Kei misbehaves during a harness session, the user can send a
bug report from the terminal with `kei feedback`, with the harness transcript
attached. It needs `kei` 0.1.20 or later (`kei --version`; upgrade with
`kei upgrade`) and a `kei login` session. The **Report a bug** button in the
console header sends to the same place.

Run it from the project directory the harness session ran in: without
`--session`, `--export` picks the most recent session for the current working
directory. `--description` is required (1 to 4000 characters).

```bash
# Claude Code (also Claude Code inside the Claude Desktop app)
kei feedback --description "What happened and what you expected" --export claude
kei feedback --description "..." --export claude --session <session-id>

# Codex
kei feedback --description "What happened and what you expected" --export codex
kei feedback --description "..." --export codex --session <session-id>

# OpenCode (needs the opencode binary on PATH; it runs opencode export)
kei feedback --description "What happened and what you expected" --export opencode
kei feedback --description "..." --export opencode --session <session-id>

# Any other harness: attach transcript files directly (repeatable)
kei feedback --description "..." --session /path/to/transcript.jsonl
```

With `--export`, `--session` takes one session ID. Without `--export`, each
`--session` is a transcript file path. `--file PATH` and `--screenshot PATH`
attach other evidence (at most 8 files, 4 MiB in total).

What happens:

1. Kei finds the transcript (or uses the session or file given).
2. Token-shaped strings are redacted on the user's machine before anything is
   sent: API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI), GitHub and Slack tokens, AWS keys,
   JWTs and `Bearer` tokens, private-key blocks, Kei runtime tokens, and
   `password=` / `token=` / `secret=` style values. Each becomes
   `[REDACTED:<kind>]`.
3. The CLI prints a preview: the description, each evidence file with its
   size, and the redaction counts per kind (never the content). Then it asks
   `Send? [y/N]`.
4. Anything other than `y`/`yes` cancels: `Feedback not submitted.` and
   nothing leaves the machine.
5. If a Kei runtime token turns up in a transcript, the CLI warns that it is a
   leak: rotate the credential (`kei bot credential --rotate`, see
   `kei-credential-rotation`) and say where it came from in the report.

Only transcripts are redacted. `--file` and `--screenshot` are sent as they
are, so check them for secrets first. Plain Claude Desktop chat sessions
(not Claude Code) are not supported yet.

**As an agent, give the user the command; do not send it for them.** The
confirmation is the user's preview of what leaves their machine. Never add
`--yes`, which skips it. In Claude Code the user can run it in the session by
typing `! kei feedback ...`.

## Troubleshooting setup

This section catalogs real failures observed during harness setup (e2e,
2026-10-05/06) and in production (2026-10-08). Each entry lists the symptom, root cause, and fix. The
matching `kei-setup-doctor` skill has a condensed version for diagnosis
workflows.

### 1. oh-my-zsh alias shadows the Kei CLI

**Symptom:** `kei` runs `kubectl edit ingress` (oh-my-zsh kubectl plugin)
instead of the Kei CLI. `kei --version` returns kubectl help.

**Cause:** oh-my-zsh defines `alias kei='kubectl edit ingress'`, which
shadows the Kei binary on `PATH`.

**Fix:** `unalias kei` in the current shell, or add `unalias kei` after
`source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh` in `~/.zshrc`. Use `command kei` to bypass
aliases.

### 2. kei or kei-proxy not installed, or wrong version

**Symptom:** `command -v kei` fails, or `kei --version` reports `< 0.1.13`
(resp. `kei-proxy --version` `< 0.1.26`).

**Cause:** The installer was not run, or the installed binary is outdated.

**Fix:** Re-run the installer and ensure `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://haikeilabs.com/install.sh | bash -s -- -d ~/.local/bin
```

### 3. Not logged in

**Symptom:** `kei workspaces list` fails with a login error.

**Cause:** No valid Kei session. `kei login` uses device-code flow — a
person must approve in the browser.

**Fix:** Run `kei login` and approve the code in the browser. The approving
account must be an owner or admin of the organization.

### 4. No runtime installation (new machine)

**Symptom:** `~/.config/kei.yaml` does not exist, or `kei runtime bootstrap`
returns 401.

**Cause:** This machine has never been set up with Kei, or its credential was
revoked. Each machine needs its own runtime installation and credential —
credentials are never shared across machines.

**Fix:** The setup scripts (`setup-*.sh`) create a new installation
automatically. Manual path:

```sh
INSTALL_NAME="<kind>@$(hostname -s)"
WS_ID=$(kei workspaces list | grep -oE '[a-f0-9-]{36}' | head -1)
INSTALL_ID=$(kei bot init --platform cli --name "$INSTALL_NAME" --workspace "$WS_ID" | grep -oE '[a-f0-9-]{36}' | head -1)
kei bot credential --installation "$INSTALL_ID" --workspace "$WS_ID" | kei setup --control-plane-url https://app.haikeilabs.com
kei runtime bootstrap
```

The credential is piped directly into `kei setup` and is never printed to the
terminal or stored in a file.

### 5. "pending" installation status (no heartbeat yet)

**Symptom:** `kei bot status` shows `"status":"pending"`.

**Cause:** The runtime has not sent its first heartbeat. `pending` is not an
error — it simply means heartbeat has not arrived yet.

**Fix:** Wait for the next heartbeat cycle. If it stays `pending` after
several minutes, check network outbound from the runtime to the control plane
and verify `KEI_RUNTIME_TOKEN` is present in the environment. Do not attempt
to bind, rotate credentials, or restart the runtime for a `pending` status
alone.

### 6. Background heartbeat service not installed

**Symptom:** No `kei runtime service` command, or the service is not
running. The runtime may stop heartbeating after the terminal session ends.

**Cause:** `kei runtime service install` ships in HAI-406 (not yet released).

**Fix:** After upgrading kei to a version that includes `kei runtime service
install`, run:

```sh
kei runtime service install
```

Until then, ensure the process has a supervision mechanism (systemd unit,
launchd plist, container restart policy) that keeps it running.

### 7. "No registered harnesses selected" after harness add

**Symptom:** `kei harness sync --harness <kind>` prints "No registered
harnesses selected" even though `kei harness add` succeeded.

**Cause:** The policy bundle cached by `kei-proxy` is stale (HAI-403). The
new harness registration is not reflected in the bundle until the next
refresh cycle (background poll interval, or a manual policy edit).

**Fix:** Any policy edit (e.g. adding or removing a harness command policy)
triggers a bundle refresh. If no policy edit is available, wait for the
background refresh (up to 6 hours). Workaround below. In your answer, point
to `kei-harness-policy` `references/bundle-versioning.md` for how bundle
versions and the 6-hour reuse window work. Workaround:

```sh
# Force a bundle refresh by touching a policy
# (no `kei policy update` exists; the deprecated `kei policies update` does this)
kei policies update <any-policy> --workspace WS --description "no-op refresh"
kei harness sync --harness <kind>
```

### 8. Policy bundle version rollback after switching installations

**Symptom:** After switching to a different runtime installation (new
credential, new bootstrap), the policy bundle loaded by `kei-proxy` is a
stale version from the previous installation. Governed calls use incorrect
(or empty) policy rules.

**Cause:** `kei-proxy` caches the policy bundle on disk at
`~/Library/Application Support/kei-proxy` (macOS) or
`~/.local/share/kei-proxy` (Linux) keyed by installation ID. When the
installation changes, the old cached bundle may be loaded if the cache
directory is not cleared (HAI-404).

**Fix:** Move the proxy cache directory aside before bootstrapping with the
new installation:

```sh
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/kei-proxy ~/Library/Application\ Support/kei-proxy.bak.$(date +%s)
# or on Linux:
# mv ~/.local/share/kei-proxy ~/.local/share/kei-proxy.bak.$(date +%s)
kei runtime bootstrap
```

After confirming the new bundle is correct, remove the backup directory.

### 9. "policy bundle candidate rejected: invalid policy bundle schema" — dst_pattern does not match

**Symptom:** `kei-proxy` logs or `kei-proxy runtime bootstrap` returns:
```
policy bundle candidate rejected: invalid policy bundle schema ... dst_pattern 'web_search' does not match
```

The specific tool (`web_search`) is denied, but other governed calls still
work — the bundle is accepted; the bare dst row is skipped.

**Cause:** A policy targets a bare tool name as its `dst_pattern` (e.g.
`web_search`), but the policy bundle schema requires a `tool:` prefix (e.g.
`tool:web_search`). The catalog now skips bare dst rows with
`skip_reason: bare_target` instead of rejecting the entire bundle. Each
skipped row grants nothing (HAI-372).

**Fix:** Update the policy's `dst_pattern` from the bare name to
`tool:<name>` in the Kei console (**Policies →** select the policy → edit
the destination pattern). For example, change `web_search` to
`tool:web_search` and `read_file` to `tool:read_file`.

```text
# Before (bare dst row, skipped)
dst_pattern: web_search

# After (enforced at call time)
dst_pattern: tool:web_search
```

If the policy was created through the CLI, update it with the deprecated
`kei policies update` (there is no `kei policy update`) or delete it and create
it again with `kei policy create --group GROUP --allow tool:web_search`:

```sh
kei policies update <name-or-id> --workspace WS --dst-pattern tool:web_search
```

Once the fix is applied, re-run `kei runtime bootstrap` or restart
`kei-proxy serve` to reload the bundle.

### 10. Every governed tool call denied (fail-closed)

**Symptom:** Every `kei-proxy authorize` returns a non-zero exit. Tools that
previously worked are now denied.

**Cause:** `KEI_PROXY_DISABLED=true` is set, `KEI_RUNTIME_TOKEN` is missing,
`KEI_RUNTIME_CONTROL_PLANE_URL` is wrong, or kei-proxy is not on `PATH`.
When kei-proxy is disabled, misconfigured, or unreachable, it denies every
governed call (fail-closed, HAI-249).

**Fix:** Check environment variables:

```sh
echo "KEI_PROXY_DISABLED=${KEI_PROXY_DISABLED:-unset}"
echo "KEI_RUNTIME_TOKEN=${KEI_RUNTIME_TOKEN:+present}"
echo "KEI_RUNTIME_CONTROL_PLANE_URL=${KEI_RUNTIME_CONTROL_PLANE_URL:-unset}"
command -v kei-proxy
```

Unset `KEI_PROXY_DISABLED` or set it to `false`, inject the token from the
secret manager, and confirm the URL is `https://app.haikeilabs.com` (no
trailing `/api/v1`). Then test with a known-permitted tool:

```sh
kei-proxy authorize --user U --tool T --action A --resource R; echo $?
```

### 11. Native config is stale after policy update

**Symptom:** Policy changes in the console are not reflected in the
harness's native config (e.g. `~/.claude/settings.json` still has old
`permissions.allow` entries).

**Cause:** The background bundle refresher updates `kei-proxy`'s in-memory
policy, but does not re-render the native config. Re-rendering needs an
explicit `kei harness sync`.

**Fix:**

```sh
kei harness sync --dry-run --harness <kind>   # preview changes
kei harness sync --harness <kind>             # apply
```

See `kei-harness-policy references/bundle-versioning.md` for the 6-hour
refresh window and versioning model.

### 12. Kei policy permits a command, but the harness denies or prompts

**Symptom:** `kei policy test` says allow, `kei harness sync` reports success,
yet the harness blocks the command (Claude Code's auto-mode classifier denies
it) or asks for approval.

**Cause:** An allow-list miss. The harness checks its rendered native allow
list first. A command with no matching entry falls through to the harness's
own permission check, which can deny it even though Kei policy permits it.
Entries match the start of the command: `cd repo && gh pr merge ...` starts with
`cd`, so a `gh` entry does not match it. A different command needs its own
entry: a pull request in a stack rejects `gh pr merge` and needs the
asynchronous merge API call (`gh api -X PUT repos/ORG/REPO/pulls/N/merge-async
...`), which starts with `gh api`, not `gh pr merge`.

**Fix:** Do not hand-edit the Kei-managed block. Add a policy for the command's
real leading tokens, then render it:

```sh
kei policy create --workspace WS --group GROUP --allow "shell:gh api"
kei harness sync --dry-run --harness claude_code
kei harness sync --harness claude_code
```

Run the command on its own, not inside `cd ... && ...`. Full explanation in
`kei-harness-policy` ("Allow-list misses").

### 13. Runtime credential was lost (no recovery)

**Symptom:** The `KEI_RUNTIME_TOKEN` environment variable is missing, and
the secret manager no longer has the value. There is no backup.

**Cause:** The credential was shown once at creation and never stored.

**Fix:** Kei stores only a hash — the plaintext cannot be recovered. Rotate
the credential:

```sh
kei bot credential --installation <ID> --rotate | <secret-manager import>
```

Update the environment variable on every consumer, then restart or reload the
runtime. Each rotation invalidates the previous credential immediately.

### 14. Every governed tool call denied with `policy_bundle_expired`

**Symptom:** Every governed tool is denied, including ones that worked
before and local tools such as `web_search`. The decision carries
`reason_code: policy_bundle_expired` and `deny_source: runtime_state`. The
console **Agents** page shows Policy bundle **Not ready** with the reason
**bundle expired**.

**Cause:** The bundle's `not_after` has passed. The catalog issues bundles
valid for 12 hours and does not reissue one when it expires ([HAI-427](https://linear.app/haikeilabs/issue/HAI-427)), so
every runtime in the workspace goes dark 12 hours after the last policy edit,
even while it is online and refreshing. (A runtime that was offline past
`not_after` shows the same symptom; restore connectivity first.)

**Check:** Look at the persisted bundle. `<state_dir>` is
`KEI_RUNTIME_STATE_DIR`, by default `~/Library/Application Support/kei-proxy`
(macOS) or `~/.local/share/kei-proxy` (Linux).

```sh
kei-proxy policy show                                   # state: expired
jq '{bundle_version, issued_at, not_after}' "<state_dir>/policy/bundle.json"
jq '{state, expires_at, highest_bundle_version}' "<state_dir>/policy/state.json"
```

`not_after` / `expires_at` in the past confirms it.

**Fix:** Make any policy edit in the workspace, in the console or with
the deprecated `kei policies update` (there is no `kei policy update`). A no-op change is enough: it forces the catalog to
issue a new bundle. A runtime running `kei-proxy serve` or
`kei-proxy runtime heartbeat` picks it up on its next poll (60 s by
default); otherwise run `kei-proxy policy sync`. `kei-proxy policy show`
should then report an active bundle with a future `not_after`. Until [HAI-427](https://linear.app/haikeilabs/issue/HAI-427)
ships, this recurs after every 12 hours without a policy edit.

## Validation commands

```sh
ls "$SKILLS_DIR" | grep '^kei'                          # skills installed
head -3 "$SKILLS_DIR/kei-cli/SKILL.md"                  # frontmatter starts with ---
kei-proxy runtime bootstrap | jq '.workspace_id'        # runtime scoped to a workspace
kei-proxy authorize --user U --tool T --action A --resource R; echo $?
kei harness list --installation INSTALLATION_ID --json | jq '.harnesses[].agent_name'   # registered harnesses (kei >v0.1.6)
```

## Realistic usage boundaries

- Do not paste runtime tokens into harness config
  files in a repo, or into the conversation.
- Installing skills changes what the agent knows, not what it may do. Policy in
  the workspace decides that.
- Agents are created in the console; there is no CLI command for that yet.
- The explicit Harness resource and short-lived runtime identity in the ADRs
  are planned. Do not present them as available.
- The installation-claim handshake IS available for chat-platform
   identities via the claim-link enrollment flow (see section 8 above), but is
   NOT available for generic harness-to-installation linking.
